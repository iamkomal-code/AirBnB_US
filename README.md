  # Problem Statement
  With this dataset we aim to develop a reliable price prediction model using machine learning and data processing techniques to aid new property owners with pricing of their property with aim to make the pricing both competitive and profitable for the new owner

   * BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING  will start by understanding the rules and business objectives of Airbnb.
   * UNDERSTANDING DATA Next step would beto collect the relevant data, describing the data and exploring the data.
   * DATA PREPARATION In this step, will prepare the data for modelling. The cleaning, integrating and formatting of data will happen in this stage.
   * MODELLING Multiple model building techniques will be used until best fit model for our problem is obtained.
   * EVALUATION - will broadly look at all our models to find out which model meets the requirement of our business problem

Using CRISP-DM Method, we were able to split our project into a number of stages which are mentioned below:

   * Data Acquisition: The data was acquired from the source http://insideairbnb.com/ this dataset contains a listing of 2021 Airbnb properties from USA and contains information like property types, room types, location data like latitudes and longitudes useful for understanding the geography of the property location, number of beds provided, the overall ambience of the property like cleanliness, and other features like amenities and creature comforts could affect the price of the property quite significantly.
   * Data Cleaning: Data cleaning involved removal of unwanted columns, treating of null values and outliers, and treating those columns and filtration of those columns which contained data which was redundant with the aim of our project.
   * Data Exploration: It involved Analyzing the Data through the EDA process and gaining Inferences of the data in order to form the base model.
   * Creating the Base Model: From the Inferences gained from the data, we moved onto creating the Basic Model.
